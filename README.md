# California-Test-Score-Analysis
This is a GROUP report. There are two aims: (i) evaluate the effects of class sizes on children's test score and (ii) build a machine learning model to predict the test scores.

There are essentially 7 parts of the report:
1. Exploratory Analysis
2. Conduct hypothesis tests for relationship between class size and average test scores
3. Assess Omitted Variable Bias (OVB) and Multicollinearity of the dataset
4. Build Linear Regression model with strong considerations for interaction and nonlinear effects with appropriate data transformation and engineering
5. Conclusion of findings on the train set
6. Select promising models and make predictions on the test set and evaluate on different dimensions: RMSE, MAD and forecasr R-square
7. Report Summary and Consulting advice

The dataset in publicly available and can be understood further via a relevant file in this repository.

Duties involved:
- Model fitting and evaluating
- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) Analysis
- Final business advice

!: As this is a Group work, it is acknowledged that other contributors be added to this repository where their Github profiles have been identified.
